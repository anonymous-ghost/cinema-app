          <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
          <p>
            To access certain features of our Services, you may be required to create an account. When creating an account,

          <h2>4. Ticket Purchases and Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            When you purchase movie tickets through our Services, you are entering into a transaction with the theater 
            operator, not with MovieApp. While we facilitate the transaction, the theater's own terms and conditions 
            regarding ticket refunds, exchanges, and canceled showings will apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, movie tickets are non-refundable except in cases of technical failure, canceled showings, or as 
            otherwise permitted by the theater operator. If you wish to request a refund, you should contact the theater 
            directly or contact our customer service for assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            MovieApp charges a service fee for ticket purchases. This fee is non-refundable even if the ticket price 
            is refunded.
